We all met to define our goals for sprint 2 and split the tasks.
We decided to divide the work into three parts:
Task 1: Save all the raw data at a given time interval (that the user can set)
Task 2: Have the data displayed with a nice UI (graphs etc..)
Task 3: Have the settings (being able to select what is displayed, where it is displayed and what is saved)
We assigned Task 1 to Nick, Task 2 to Lo√Øc and Roberto and Task 3 to Yuan and Ambre.

During the week, each group met individually to discuss their own parts.
