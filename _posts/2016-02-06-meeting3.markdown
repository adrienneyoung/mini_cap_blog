Meeting 3 - Minutes

Participants: Nick, Loic, Ambre, Roberto

Our Data Acquisition Toll which is focused on tracking a driver's behavior and return feedback.

We have decided that our main client will be SAE (Societe Automobile des Ingenieur) which is a student run vehicle prototyping competition. As well as the general public drivers that are concerned with fuel consumption, tracking for new drivers, car enthusiasts, and insurers.

Deciding on the features by priority

1. Direct accelerometer feedback: displays acceleration behavior on screen

2. Drifting detection: Alerts driver when car is drifting
 
3. GPS for speed and position: generates a route that has a heatmap based on acceleration and position - Energy expenditure based on Vehicule type

4. Video Safety: When large spikes in (de)acceleration occurs, returns last 10 seconds of footage
