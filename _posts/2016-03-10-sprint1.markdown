We met Yuan, our new team member and gave him a brief introduction of our app. We discussed its main functionalities (which include: data recording and real-time tracking) as well as its general design.
We also came up with a few ideas of the settings we wanted to implement, such as the language, the units (Miles/hour and Km/hour) and the color-blind mode.
Nick also clarified a few questions we had on the programming of the GPS and the gyroscope.
During this meeting (and after) we all got more familiar with GITHUB and its commands (add, commit, push and pull)
We ended the meeting by splitting the tasks for sprint 2.
